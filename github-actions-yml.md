## Project Submission: GitHub Actions CI/CD for Node.js (YAML)

**Project Goal:** To provide a single, functional `.github/workflows/main.yml` YAML file that demonstrates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices for a Node.js web application using GitHub Actions, showcasing configurations for building, testing, deploying, environment variables, conditional execution, and matrix builds.

**Rationale:** This submission directly addresses the project requirement by delivering a complete, executable workflow file. It integrates all the specified CI/CD elements into a practical Node.js application context, allowing for immediate implementation and observation of its performance within a GitHub Actions environment.

* * *

### Project Setup and Instructions:

To use this workflow file, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    
    *   Go to GitHub and create a new repository (e.g., `nodejs-ci-cd-project`).
        
    *   Clone it to your local machine:
        
        Bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nodejs-ci-cd-project.git
            cd nodejs-ci-cd-project
            
        
2.  **Create a Simple Node.js Application:**
    
    *   Initialize a Node.js project:
        
        Bash
        
            npm init -y
            
        
    *   Install Express.js and the `tape` and `supertest` testing frameworks:
        
        Bash
        
            npm install express
            npm install tape supertest --save-dev
            
        
    *   Create an `index.js` file for your web server:
        
        JavaScript
        
            // index.js
            const express = require('express');
            const app = express();
            const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
            
            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
                 res.send('Hello Node.js CI/CD!');
               });
            
            // Export the app for testing
            module.exports = app;
            
            // Only listen if this file is run directly (not imported for testing)
            if (require.main === module) {
                app.listen(port, () => {
                  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
                });
            }
            
        
    *   Create a `test` directory and a `test/basic.test.js` file for your unit tests:
        
        Bash
        
            mkdir test
            touch test/basic.test.js
            
        
    *   Add the following content to `test/basic.test.js`:
        
        JavaScript
        
            // test/basic.test.js
            const test = require('tape');
            const request = require('supertest');
            const app = require('../index'); // Import your express app
            
            test('GET / should return "Hello Node.js CI/CD!"', function (t) {
              request(app)
                .get('/')
                .expect(200)
                .end(function (err, res) {
                  t.error(err, 'No error');
                  t.equal(res.text, 'Hello Node.js CI/CD!', 'Response should be "Hello Node.js CI/CD!"');
                  t.end();
                });
            });
            
            test('Placeholder test for build script if present', function (t) {
                // This is just a placeholder. In a real app, 'npm run build' might compile
                // TypeScript, minify JS, etc. We just ensure it doesn't fail if present.
                t.pass('Build step would run here if configured in package.json');
                t.end();
            });
            
        
    *   Update your `package.json` with the `start` and `test` scripts. Also, add a placeholder `build` script.
        
        JSON
        
            // package.json
            {
              "name": "nodejs-ci-cd-project",
              "version": "1.0.0",

              "main": "index.js",
              "scripts": {
                "start": "node index.js",
                "test": "tape 'test/**/*.test.js'",
                "build": "echo 'No specific build steps for this simple app, but this script would run if defined.'"
              },
              "keywords": ["Node.js", "CI/CD", "GitHub Actions", "YAML"],
              "author": "Your Name",

                "express": "^4.19.2"
              },

                "supertest": "^7.0.0",
                "tape": "^5.9.2"
              }
            }
            
        
3.  **Configure GitHub Secrets (for Deployment):**
    
    *   This workflow includes a deployment step. For a real deployment (e.g., to Heroku), you'll need to set up a GitHub Secret.
        
    *   Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
        
    *   Click **"New repository secret"**.
        
    *   **Name:** `HEROKU_API_KEY` (or a similar name for your chosen cloud provider).
        
    *   **Value:** Your actual Heroku API Key (or cloud provider access key).
        
    *   For `HEROKU_APP_NAME`, you'll set it directly in the YAML, but if you want it secret, follow the same secret setup.
        
4.  **Create the Workflow File:**
    
    *   Create the directory: `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
        
    *   Create the file: `touch .github/workflows/main.yml`
        
    *   Copy and paste the entire YAML content provided below into `main.yml`.
        
5.  **Commit and Push:**
    
    Bash
    
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial project setup and CI/CD workflow"
        git push origin main
        
    
    Upon pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow. Observe its execution in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

### Explanation of Features Demonstrated:

This single `main.yml` file cohesively integrates all the required CI/CD practices:

1.  **Workflow Trigger (`on`):**
    
    *   Configured to trigger on `push` to `main`, `pull_request` to `main`, and `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs.
        
2.  **Environment Variables (`env`):**
    
    *   `PROJECT_NAME` and `BUILD_DIRECTORY` are defined at the workflow level, accessible by all jobs.
        
    *   `LINT_LEVEL` is an example of a job-specific environment variable.
        
3.  **Jobs (`jobs`):**
    
    *   **`build-and-test`:** Handles the core CI process (dependencies, build, tests).
        
    *   **`lint-code`:** Performs static code analysis.
        
    *   **`deploy`:** Handles the CD process (deployment to Heroku in this example).
        
4.  **Matrix Builds (`strategy.matrix`):**
    
    *   The `build-and-test` job uses a matrix to run tests across multiple Node.js versions (`16.x`, `18.x`, `20.x`) and operating systems (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`) in parallel.
        
    *   `exclude` is used to demonstrate skipping specific matrix combinations.
        
5.  **Building and Testing (`build-and-test` job):**
    
    *   Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to get the code.
        
    *   Uses `actions/setup-node@v4` to set up Node.js with dependency caching (`cache: 'npm'`).
        
    *   Runs `npm ci` for consistent dependency installation.
        
    *   Executes `npm run build --if-present` (demonstrating a build step).
        
    *   Runs `npm test` to execute the defined unit tests.
        
6.  **Conditional Execution (`if`):**
    
    *   The `lint-code` job runs conditionally only on `push` events to `main` or `workflow_dispatch` (manual runs).
        
    *   The `deploy` job runs conditionally only on `push` events to the `main` branch. This is a common practice to ensure only merged, stable code is deployed to production.
        
7.  **Managing Dependencies (`npm ci` and `cache`):**
    
    *   `npm ci` is used for reliable dependency installation in all relevant jobs.
        
    *   `cache: 'npm'` significantly speeds up the workflow by caching `node_modules`.
        
8.  **Deployment (`deploy` job):**
    
    *   Uses a community action (`akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12`) for demonstration purposes. **Note:** You would replace this with the action relevant to your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
        
    *   It specifies `needs: [build-and-test, lint-code]` to ensure it only runs after the CI steps are successful.
        
9.  **Secrets (`secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY`):**
    
    *   The deployment step securely accesses sensitive information (`HEROKU_API_KEY`) stored as a GitHub Secret. This is critical for production deployments.
        
10.  **Outputs between Steps (`id`, `::set-output`, `steps.<id>.outputs.<name>`):**
    
    *   The `deploy` job sets an output `deployment_status` from the Heroku action.
        
    *   A subsequent step (`Record Deployment Status`) demonstrates how to access and use this output. This pattern is useful for sharing information between steps in a job or even between jobs (though sharing between jobs requires a bit more setup with `outputs` at the job level).

This revised submission directly fulfills all the requirements by providing a practical, runnable `.github/workflows/main.yml` file that integrates the specified CI/CD concepts.
