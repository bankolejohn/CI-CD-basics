## 2\. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture Diagram

The core architecture for this project involves a single Jenkins instance deployed on a virtual machine or server. This Jenkins instance will interact with a Source Code Management (SCM) system (e.g., Git repository) to pull code. It will also interact with Docker for containerization aspects of the CI/CD pipeline.
