# DevOps Project Documentation: Introduction to Jenkins for CI/CD

## 1\. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

*   **Project Name:** Introduction to Jenkins for CI/CD
    
*   **Purpose/Goals:** This project aims to provide learners with a foundational understanding of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) principles, and to articulate their role in improving software development processes. It focuses on acquiring proficiency in using Jenkins, covering installation, configuration, navigation, and hands-on experience in creating and managing Jenkins jobs and pipelines. The ultimate goal is to enable learners to automate software builds, run automated tests, and deploy applications using Jenkins, while applying CI/CD best practices including parameterized builds, integration with external tools, and leveraging containerization technologies like Docker. **Specifically, this project guides users through creating and configuring Jenkins Freestyle projects, connecting Jenkins to GitHub for Source Code Management, setting up automated build triggers using webhooks, and then extends to creating and executing Jenkins Pipeline jobs for containerized applications.**
    
*   **Scope:** This documentation covers the theoretical introduction to CI/CD and Jenkins, practical steps for Jenkins installation and initial setup, creation and configuration of Jenkins Freestyle and Pipeline jobs, connecting Jenkins to Source Code Management, configuring build triggers, writing Jenkins Pipeline scripts, and integrating Docker into the pipeline.

## 2\. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture Diagram

The core architecture for this project involves a single Jenkins instance deployed on a virtual machine or server. This Jenkins instance will interact with a Source Code Management (SCM) system (e.g., Git repository) to pull code. It will also interact with Docker for containerization aspects of the CI/CD pipeline.

    +-------------------+       +-------------------+

## 3\. Infrastructure

### 3.1 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Tooling:** Not explicitly used for infrastructure provisioning in this project. Jenkins installation is performed via manual `apt` commands.
    
*   **Repository Location:** N/A (manual installation)
    
*   **Directory Structure:** N/A (manual installation)
    
*   **Key Modules/Resources:** N/A (manual installation)
    
*   **Environments:** This project primarily focuses on a single Jenkins instance setup, typically for a development or learning environment.
    
    *   **Development:** The Jenkins instance set up as per the instructions.
        
    *   **Staging:** Not covered in this project.
        
    *   **Production:** Not covered in this project.
        

### 3.2 Network Configuration

*   **VPC/VNet/Networking Details:** Assumed to be a standard network configuration where the Jenkins instance resides. Specific details are dependent on the underlying cloud provider or on-premise setup.
    
*   **Security Groups/Network ACLs:** An inbound rule must be created for **TCP port 8080** in the security group associated with the Jenkins instance. This allows web browser access to the Jenkins UI.
    
*   **Load Balancers:** Not applicable for this single-instance setup.
    
*   **DNS Management:** Access is via direct IP address (`http://public_ip_address:8080`). DNS management is not covered.
    

### 3.3 Compute Resources

*   **Virtual Machines/Instances:** A Linux-based virtual machine or server (e.g., Debian-based) is required to host the Jenkins installation. Specific instance types or sizes are not detailed but should be sufficient to run Jenkins and Docker.
    
*   **Containers/Orchestration:** Docker is installed on the Jenkins host to support containerized builds and deployments as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Kubernetes or other orchestrators are not part of this project's scope.
    
*   **Serverless Functions:** Not applicable.
    

### 3.4 Data Storage

*   **Database Instances:** Not applicable for the Jenkins setup itself. Jenkins stores its configuration and job data on the local filesystem of the instance, typically in `/var/lib/jenkins`.
    
*   **Object Storage:** Not applicable.
    
*   **File Storage:** Not applicable beyond the local filesystem.
    

### 3.5 Jenkins Installation Steps

Now that we have an idea what Jenkins is, let's dive into installing Jenkins.

1.  **Update package repositories:**
    
        sudo apt update
        
    
2.  **Install JDK (Java Development Kit):** Jenkins requires Java to run.
    
        sudo apt install default-jdk-headless
        
    
3.  **Install Jenkins:**
    
        wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
        /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt-get install jenkins
        
    
    This command sequence installs Jenkins. It involves importing the Jenkins GPG key for package verification, adding the Jenkins repository to the system's sources, updating package lists, and finally, installing Jenkins through the package manager (`apt-get`).
    
4.  **Check if Jenkins has been installed and is up and running:**
    
        sudo systemctl status jenkins
        
    

### 3.6 Jenkins Web Console Setup

After installation, you need to configure Jenkins through its web interface.

1.  **Create new inbound rules for port 8080 in the security group:** By default, Jenkins listens on port 8080. You need to create an inbound rule for this port in the security group of your Jenkins instance (e.g., in your cloud provider's console or firewall settings) to allow external access.
    
2.  **Access Jenkins On The Web Console:** Input your Jenkins Instance IP address on your web browser: `http://public_ip_address:8080`
    
3.  **Retrieve Initial Admin Password:** On your Jenkins instance (via SSH), check the following path to find your initial administrator password:
    
        sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
        
    
    Copy this password and paste it into the Jenkins web interface to unlock Jenkins.
    
4.  **Install Suggested Plugins:** After unlocking, Jenkins will prompt you to install suggested plugins. It is recommended to proceed with this option.
    
5.  **Create a User Account:** Follow the prompts to create your first admin user account for Jenkins.
    
6.  **Log in to Jenkins Console:** Once the setup is complete and the user account is created, you will be redirected to the Jenkins dashboard.
    

## 4\. CI/CD Pipeline

### 4.1 Overview

*   **CI/CD Tool:** Jenkins
    
*   **Pipeline Stages:** The project highlights the creation of both Freestyle and Pipeline jobs. A typical pipeline would involve stages like:
    
    *   Source Code Checkout
        
    *   Build
        
    *   Test
        
    *   Deployment (conceptual within the project)
        
*   **Triggering Mechanisms:** Jenkins is configured to trigger builds automatically upon code changes detected in the connected version control system (e.g., Git pushes). Manual triggers are also possible.
    

### 4.2 Build Process

*   **Build Artifacts:** The project implies the generation of build artifacts, though specific types (e.g., JAR, WAR, Docker images) are not detailed. Artifacts would typically be stored by Jenkins or pushed to an artifact repository.
    
*   **Dependency Management:** Handled as part of the application's build process within Jenkins jobs (e.g., Maven, npm, pip).
    
*   **Unit Testing:** The project emphasizes running automated tests as part of the CI/CD process. Specific frameworks or reporting are not detailed.
    

### 4.3 Testing and Quality Gates

*   **Integration Testing:** Mentioned as a goal to be learned, but specific implementation details are not provided in the installation guide.
    
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Mentioned as a goal to be learned, but specific implementation details are not provided.
    
*   **Security Scans:** Not covered in this project.
    
*   **Code Quality Checks:** Not covered in this project.
    

### 4.4 Deployment Process

*   **Deployment Strategy:** The project aims for learners to deploy applications using Jenkins. Specific strategies (e.g., Blue/Green, Canary) are not detailed, but the focus is on automating the deployment.
    
*   **Target Environments:** Deployment to various environments is a general concept of CD, but specific target environments are not configured within this project's setup guide.
    
*   **Rollback Procedure:** Not explicitly detailed in the provided project description.
    
*   **Secrets Management:** Initial Jenkins setup involves retrieving an initial admin password. For pipeline secrets (e.g., credentials for deploying), Jenkins' built-in credentials management or plugins would be used, though not explicitly detailed in the provided text.
    

### 4.5 Pipeline Scripting and Execution

This section details how to define and execute CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

#### 4.5.1 Jenkins Job Overview

In Jenkins, a job is a unit of work or a task that can be executed by the Jenkins automation server. A Jenkins job represents a specific task or set of tasks that needs to be performed as part of a build or deployment process. Jobs in Jenkins are created to automate the execution of various steps such as compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and deploying them to servers. Each Jenkins job is configured with a series of build steps, post-build actions, and other settings that define how the job should be executed.

#### 4.5.2 Creating a Freestyle Project

Freestyle projects are a basic type of Jenkins job that allows you to configure build steps, SCM, and post-build actions through the Jenkins UI. This is a good starting point for simple tasks.

To create your first build job:

1.  From the Jenkins dashboard menu on the left side, click on **"New Item"**.
    
2.  Select **"Freestyle project"** and name it `my-first-job`. Click **"OK"**.
    

#### 4.5.3 Connecting Jenkins To Our Source Code Management (GitHub)

Now that you have created a freestyle project, let's connect Jenkins with GitHub.

1.  Create a new GitHub repository, for example, named `jenkins-scm`, with a `README.md` file.
    
2.  In your Jenkins Freestyle project configuration, navigate to the **"Source Code Management"** section.
    
3.  Select **"Git"** and paste the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-scm.git`) into the "Repository URL" field.
    
4.  Ensure your branch specifier is set to `*/main` (or `*/master` depending on your repository's default branch).
    
5.  Save the configuration.
    
6.  Run "Build Now" from the job's dashboard to initiate a build. This will connect Jenkins to your repository and pull the code.
    
    You have successfully connected Jenkins with your GitHub repository (`jenkins-scm`).
    

#### 4.5.4 Configuring Build Trigger (Freestyle)

As an engineer, we need to be able to automate things and make our work easier in possible ways. We have connected Jenkins to `jenkins-scm`, but we cannot run a new build without clicking on **"Build Now"**. To eliminate this, we need to configure a build trigger for our Jenkins job. With this, Jenkins will run a new build anytime a change is made to our GitHub repository.

1.  Click **"Configure"** for your `my-first-job`.
    
2.  Navigate to the **"Build Triggers"** section.
    
3.  Check the option **"GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"**.
    
4.  Save the job configuration.
    
5.  **Create a GitHub Webhook:**
    
    *   Go to your GitHub repository (`jenkins-scm`) settings.
        
    *   Navigate to **"Webhooks"** and click **"Add webhook"**.
        
    *   For **"Payload URL"**, use your Jenkins instance IP address and port followed by `/github-webhook/` (e.g., `http://public_ip_address:8080/github-webhook/`).
        
    *   Set **"Content type"** to `application/json`.
        
    *   Choose **"Just the push event"** or **"Send me everything"** based on your preference.
        
    *   Ensure **"Active"** is checked.
        
    *   Click **"Add webhook"**.
        
    
    Now, go ahead and make some change in any file in your GitHub repository (e.g., `README.MD` file) and push the changes to the `main` branch. You will see that a new build has been launched automatically (triggered by the webhook).
    

#### 4.5.5 What is a Jenkins Pipeline Job

A Jenkins pipeline job is a way to define and automate a series of steps in the software delivery process. It allows you to script and organize your entire build, test, and deployment. Jenkins pipelines enable organizations to define, visualize, and execute intricate build, test, and deployment processes as code. This facilitates the seamless integration of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices into software development.

#### 4.5.6 Creating a Pipeline Job

Let's create our first pipeline job:

1.  From the Jenkins dashboard menu on the left side, click on **"New Item"**.
    
2.  Select **"Pipeline"** and name it `My pipeline job`. Click **"OK"**.
    

#### 4.5.7 Configuring Build Trigger (Pipeline)

Like we did previously in the earlier project, create a build trigger for Jenkins to trigger new builds for your Pipeline job.

1.  Click **"Configure"** for your `My pipeline job`.
    
2.  Navigate to the **"Build Triggers"** section.
    
3.  Check the option **"GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"**.
    
4.  Save the job configuration. Since you have already created a GitHub webhook previously for the `jenkins-scm` repository, you do not need to create another one again. Changes pushed to `jenkins-scm` will now trigger this pipeline job as well.
    

#### 4.5.8 Writing Jenkins Pipeline Script

A Jenkins pipeline script refers to a script that defines and orchestrates the steps and stages of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Jenkins pipelines can be defined using either declarative or scripted syntax. Declarative syntax is a more structured and concise way to define pipelines. It uses a domain-specific language to describe the pipeline stages, steps, and other configurations while scripted syntax provides more flexibility and is suitable for complex scripting requirements.

Let's write our pipeline script (Declarative Pipeline):

    pipeline {
        agent any
    
        stages {
            stage('Connect To Github') {
                steps {
                        checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/main']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/RidwanAz/jenkins-scm.git']])
                }
            }
            stage('Build Docker Image') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        sh 'docker build -t dockerfile .'
                    }
                }
            }
            stage('Run Docker Container') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        sh 'docker run -itd --name nginx -p 8081:80 dockerfile'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

**Explanation of the script above:**

The provided Jenkins pipeline script defines a series of stages for a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process. Let's break down each stage:

*   **Agent Configuration:**
    
        agent any
        
    
    Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (an agent can either be a Jenkins master or node). This means the pipeline is not tied to a specific node type.
    
*   **Stages:**
    
        stages {
            // Stages go here
        }
        
    
    Defines the various stages of the pipeline, each representing a phase in the software delivery process.
    
*   **Stage 1: Connect To Github:**
    
        stage('Connect To Github') {
            steps {
                checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/main']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/RidwanAz/jenkins-scm.git']])
            }
        }
        
    
    This stage checks out the source code from a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/RidwanAz/jenkins-scm.git`). It specifies that the pipeline should use the `main` branch.
    
*   **Stage 2: Build Docker Image:**
    
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'docker build -t dockerfile .'
                }
            }
        }
        
    
    This stage builds a Docker image named `dockerfile` using the source code obtained from the GitHub repository. The `docker build` command is executed using the shell (`sh`).
    
*   **Stage 3: Run Docker Container:**
    
        stage('Run Docker Container') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'docker run -itd --name nginx -p 8081:80 dockerfile'
                }
            }
        }
        
    
    This stage runs a Docker container named `nginx` in detached mode (`-itd`). The container is mapped to port 8081 on the host machine (`-p 8081:80`). The Docker image used is the one built in the previous stage (`dockerfile`).
    

**To paste the pipeline script:** In your `My pipeline job` configuration, navigate to the **"Pipeline"** section. Select "Pipeline script" from the "Definition" dropdown and paste the entire script above into the "Script" text area.

#### 4.5.9 Generating Pipeline Syntax

The stage 1 of the script connects Jenkins to a GitHub repository. To generate syntax for your GitHub repository (e.g., for `checkout` step), follow the steps below:

1.  In your Jenkins Pipeline job configuration, click on **"Pipeline Syntax"** (usually found below the "Script" text area).
    
2.  Select the dropdown for "Sample Step" and search for `checkout: Check out from version control`.
    
3.  Choose **"Git"** as the SCM.
    
4.  Paste your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/RidwanAz/jenkins-scm.git`) into the "Repository URL" field.
    
5.  Make sure your branch is `main` (or `master`).
    
6.  Click **"Generate Pipeline Script"**.
    

Now you can replace the generated script for connecting Jenkins with GitHub in your `Jenkinsfile` if you need to customize it.

#### 4.5.10 Installing Docker

Before Jenkins can run Docker commands, you need to install Docker on the same instance where Jenkins was installed. From our shell scripting knowledge, let's install Docker with a shell script.

1.  Create a file named `docker.sh` on your Jenkins instance.
    
2.  Open the file and paste the script below:
    
        sudo apt-get update -y
        sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg -y
        sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        
        # Add the repository to Apt sources:
        echo \
          "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
          $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
        sudo apt-get update -y
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
        sudo systemctl status docker
        
    
3.  Save and close the file.
    
4.  Make the file executable:
    
        chmod u+x docker.sh
        
    
5.  Execute the file:
    
        ./docker.sh
        
    
    You have successfully installed Docker.
    

#### 4.5.11 Building Pipeline Script (Dockerfile and index.html)

Now that you have Docker installed on the same instance as Jenkins, you need to create a `Dockerfile` and an `index.html` file in your `jenkins-scm` GitHub repository before you can run your pipeline script. As we know, you cannot build a Docker image without a `Dockerfile`. Let's recall the `Dockerfile` we used to build a Docker image in our Docker foundations.

In the `main` branch of your `jenkins-scm` GitHub repository:

1.  Create a new file named `Dockerfile`.
    
2.  Paste the code snippet below into the file:
    
        # Use the official NGINX base image
        FROM nginx:latest
        
        # Set the working directory in the container
        WORKDIR  /usr/share/nginx/html/
        
        # Copy the local HTML file to the NGINX default public directory
        COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
        
        # Expose port 80 to allow external access
        EXPOSE 80
        
    
3.  Create an `index.html` file in the same repository and paste the content below:
    
        Congratulations, You have successfully run your first pipeline code.
        
    
4.  Pushing these files (`Dockerfile` and `index.html`) to the `main` branch will trigger Jenkins to automatically run a new build for your pipeline job (due to the webhook configured earlier).
    

To access the content of `index.html` on your web browser, you need to first edit inbound rules in your Jenkins instance's security group and open the port you mapped your container to (8081).

You can now access the content of `index.html` on your web browser: `http://jenkins-ip-address:8081`

*   **Server Logs:** Standard OS logs (e.g., `syslog`).
    
*   **Cloud Service Logs:** Not applicable for this project's scope.
    

### 6.2 Log Aggregation and Analysis

*   **Log Aggregator:** Not covered in this project.
    
*   **Log Storage:** Logs are stored locally on the Jenkins instance. Retention policies are not specified.
    
*   **Log Querying/Analysis:** Manual inspection of log files or via the Jenkins UI.
    

## 7\. Security

### 7.1 Access Control

*   **IAM/RBAC Strategy:** Jenkins provides its own user management and role-based access control (RBAC) through plugins. The project includes steps to "Create a user account" and "Log in to jenkins console".
    
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implicitly encouraged by creating dedicated user accounts, but not detailed.
    

### 7.2 Secrets Management

*   **Tooling:** Initial admin password retrieval from `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. For pipeline secrets, Jenkins' built-in credentials management is the primary tool, though not explicitly detailed in the provided text.
    
*   **Process:** Initial password retrieval is a manual step.
    

### 7.3 Network Security

*   **Firewalls/Security Groups:** Crucial step: "create new inbound rules for port 8080 in security group" to allow access to the Jenkins UI.
    
*   **VPN/Direct Connect:** Not applicable.
    

### 7.4 Compliance and Auditing

*   **Relevant Standards:** Not covered.
    
*   **Audit Trails:** Jenkins maintains a history of job executions and user actions, serving as a basic audit trail.
    

## 8\. Incident Management and Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Incident Response Plan

*   **Severity Levels:** Not covered.
    
*   **Communication Plan:** Not covered.
    
*   **Post-Mortem Process:** Not covered.
    

### 8.2 Runbooks/Troubleshooting Guides

*   **Common Issues:**
    
    *   **Jenkins Service Not Running:** Check `sudo systemctl status jenkins`.
        
    *   **Cannot Access Jenkins UI:** Verify port 8080 inbound rule in security group, check Jenkins service status.
        
    *   **Incorrect Initial Admin Password:** Double-check the path `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.
        
*   **Diagnostic Steps:** Use `systemctl status jenkins`, check server logs, review Jenkins job console output.
    
*   **Resolution Steps:** Restart Jenkins service, adjust security group rules, re-enter password.
    
*   **Escalation Matrix:** Not covered.
    

## 9\. Cost Management

### 9.1 Cost Monitoring

*   **Tools:** Not covered; depends on the cloud provider's billing tools if hosted in the cloud.
    
*   **Key Cost Drivers:** The primary cost driver would be the virtual machine/server hosting Jenkins.
    

### 9.2 Cost Optimization Strategies

*   **Resource Sizing:** Not covered, but choosing an appropriately sized VM is important.
    
*   **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans:** Not applicable for this project's scope.
    
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Not applicable for a single Jenkins instance.
    

## 10\. Onboarding Guide

### 10.1 Getting Started

*   **Repository Access:** Learners will need access to the source code repository that their Jenkins jobs will build from.
    
*   **Local Development Setup:** Not explicitly detailed for the application code, but the Jenkins installation steps are provided.
    
*   **Key Contacts:** N/A (for a self-paced project).
